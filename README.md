# Stock Analysis with VBA

## Overview

In this challenge, I helped a friend analyze stock data in Excel. Through VBA, I was able to analyze the total traded volume and total returns for 12 different stocks.
My initial code analyzed the data quickly, but it would probably not be fast enough to analyze thousands of stocks options. Therefore, I was tasked with refactoring my initial code, so that it would run faster. 

## Analysis

Originally, my code yielded the following stock analysis results for the years 2017 and 2018, respectively:
